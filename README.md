# Reviewing Data and Performance Analysis of Various  Machine Learning Models on Amazon Review Data-Sets

The goal of this project is to analyse the Amazon food review data to understand customer 
behaviour. On analysing data, the query arises on customer behaviour on products. Like, is 
the customer focused on brand or price? Is the customer review time-dependent? This paper 
has done every possible analysis of the data. This paper has also run the three different model 
to understand which model will be best for predicting the rating based on comments


# CONCLUSION

The Graph analysis and table analysis clearly show that the customer is interested in Apple
products because most review is given on Apple products which are around 807. It also 
concluded that even though the review is high for Apple products, the rating, price and 
review count are almost high for Samsung S7. The price and rating from Figure 4 are not 
very much correlated. So on observing data, this dataset is an old dataset, a 7years old. So it 
cannot be time-dependent, because Figure 1 displays that customers are interested in Apple 
products, but the rating is high for Samsung s7, which means when a new modification
comes the customer would like to switch to Apple products, which may also cause the high 
price of apple products in the future. After analysis of Machine learning models, the accuracy 
is higher for the random forest, which was expected for a hybrid model. The reason why the 
hybrid model doesn’t perform well because in this paper we didn’t consider any requirement 
of hyperparameter and the best part of random forest is it has default hyperparameter-like n-
estimator, features. Etc That is why the result of random forest is better than another model. 
But it has limitations, on quick prediction of data, because random forest takes a lot of time to 
run the model. So on real time and quick prediction it cant be used.
